# TasksApp (Symfony).

Application made with Symfony (PHP), MySQL, is fully Responsive and is available on the web.

App created for a work team. Users must register and log in.

All the tasks in the main section of all users members of the work team are listed, then they can monitor their status and know to whom each task corresponds.

All the functions are activated if the user who has logged in is the owner of the task, and tasks that are not from the user will only have activated the Detail button.

Each user must add their tasks in the create task section specifying the description, priority, and budgeted hours. The application will add the date and time of creation, the name of the user who created it.

My Tasks section will list only the tasks of the logged user and will have available all the functions enabled.

When the user finishes a task, they must press the finish button to close the said task, then the app will add the date and time of completion and calculate the time it took to complete this task, and now any user can compare it with the budgeted time.

The Actions section in the main table will change if the user who logged in created the task or not. If the user created that task, actions: detail, edit, and delete will be available. If the user is not the owner of this task, only the action detail will appear

The user who owns a task will have the option to add a completion comment, which is available only if this task has the status "completed" and can also edit the comment.

The application has a random background function to give a dynamic view. The background image will change every time the user changes the section or updates the browser.
